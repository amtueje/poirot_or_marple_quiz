## Prerequisites

You will need Python installed on your computer. The recommended version is Python 3.6 or higher.

## Problem Statement

This Python quiz was designed to help me understand nested "if" statements in Python code and is part of the Day 7 Challenge from Replit's 100 Days of Code course. This program will ask you a series of questions and, based on your answers, will recommend specific episodes featuring Agatha Christie's famous detectives, Hercule Poirot and Jane Marple.

## Getting Started

1. Create a new repository on GitHub.
2. Clone the repository to your local machine: git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yourrepository.git
3. Add the provided Python code to the repository.
4. Create a README.md file in the repository and paste the contents of this file.

## Usage

1. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing the Python code.
2. Run the script with the command: python poirot_or_marple.py
3. Follow the on-screen prompts to receive a TV episode recommendation featuring Hercule Poirot or Jane Marple.

## Contributing

1. Fork the repository on GitHub.
2. Create a new branch with a descriptive name: git checkout -b your-feature-branch
3. Make changes to the code.
4. Commit your changes with a clear and concise commit message: git commit -m "Your commit message"
5. Push your changes to your fork: git push origin your-feature-branch
6. Open a Pull Request on the original repository.

### Note
As well as using this project to learn Python, I'm also using it to learn about GitHub too, hence the over elaborate README for such a tiny project. It all helps, though!
